# DDoS Protection Guide for your Minecraft Server!

Find out how to stop any DDoS attacks from harming your Minecraft Server.

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks can start lagging your sever and make everyone's ping higher or they can fully take your server down and kick everyone. There are many ways to protect yourself against these attacks and in this guide you will find out how to and which option is the best for you.

## Do I need DDoS Protection?
If you have a private server for your friends, then you don't need any sort of DDoS protection (unless your friends are crazy) and your host might already have some out of the box. Servers that are open to the public, even the ones with 20 players, can be targets of attacks. It also depends if you have some sort of competition or if someone really dislikes you. Sometimes attackers stop after few hours and they don't come back. There isn't a perfect way to determine if you need protection but if your server has been taking hits quite often recently or you're having a big launch and you can't have any downtime, then it's worth the extra money, time and effort to protect your server.

### Dedicated Server Providers
These are some dedicated server providers which come with good DDoS protection out of the box.

- [Tempest](https://tempest.net) (Path.net) - great
- [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com) - medium
- [CosmicGuard](https://cosmicguard.com) - great
- [Bloom.host](https://bloom.host) - medium
- [BerryByte](https://berrybyte.net) (CosmicGuard) - great
- [PufferFish](https://pufferfish.host) (CosmicGuard) - great

### DDoS Protection Service with a panel
These services have an easy to use panel and they're the best option for most of servers. All servers with five stars have great protection and you likely wouldn't have any challenges with DDoS attacks. What can vary from protection to protection is the distance from their servers to your server, as well as the stability and the ping of the connection for the players. Prioritize choosing close locations, even at higher pricing. Panel and its features are other things you could look into it. TCPShield, as the oldest company out there, provides the most stability and allows you to simply subscribe and forget about it, however newer options like NeoProtect, Infinity Filter and Papyrus offer more direct support and customization for your server.

#### Infinity Filter

I've been personally using Infinity Filter in the past and it has the one of the best protections out there if not the best and it's pay as you go pricing helped us run huge events for really cheap. The panel could use some work but overall the service is fantastic.

#### CosmicGuard

CosmicGuard is more expensive than Infinity Filter with their service but their dedicated servers and other dedicated servers providers that use them offer a good price with great protection. Their filters worked almost every time for me, sometimes they need to tune in their filters just for you, especially with cracked servers.

TCPShield is the most popular service but it's more expensive than other OVH options like Infinity Filter. They have a great reputation and they're a very trusted option. Used by 2b2t and MrBeast.
