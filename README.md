# DDoS Protection Guide for your Minecraft Server!

Find out how to stop any DDoS attacks from harming your Minecraft Server.

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks can start lagging your sever and make everyone's ping higher or they can fully take your server down and kick everyone. There are many ways to protect yourself against these attacks and in this guide you will find out how to and which option is the best for you.

## Do I need DDoS Protection?
If you have a private server for your friends, then you don't need any sort of DDoS protection (unless your friends are crazy) and your host might already have some out of the box. Servers that are open to the public, even the ones with 20 players, can be targets of attacks. It also depends if you have some sort of competition or if someone really dislikes you. Sometimes attackers stop after few hours and they don't come back. There isn't a perfect way to determine if you need protection but if your server has been taking hits quite often recently or you're having a big launch and you can't have any downtime, then it's worth the extra money, time and effort to protect your server.

### Dedicated Server Providers
These are some dedicated server providers which come with good DDoS protection out of the box.

- [Tempest](https://tempest.net) (Path.net)
- [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com)
- [CosmicGuard](https://cosmicguard.com)
- [Bloom.host](https://bloom.host) (CloudFlare)
- [BerryByte](https://berrybyte.net) (CosmicGuard)
- [PufferFish](https://pufferfish.host) (CosmicGuard)

### DDoS Protection Service with a panel
These services have an easy to use panel and they're the best option for most of server owners.

#### Infinity Filter

I've been personally using Infinity Filter and it has the one of the best protections out there if not the best and it's pay as you go pricing helped us run huge events for really cheap. The panel could use some work but overall the service is fantastic.

- [Website](https://www.infinity-filter.com)
- Locations: Germany, France, Canada (Montreal)
- Pricing type: Pay-as-you-go
- Servers: OVH
- Supports Bedrock: Yes
- Free plan: Yes
- Trusted: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

#### CosmicGuard

CosmicGuard is more expensive than Infinity Filter with their service but their dedicated servers and other dedicated servers providers that use them offer a good price with great protection. Their filters worked almost every time for me, sometimes they need to tune in their filters just for you.

- [Website](https://cosmicguard.com)
- Locations: Ashburn, Dallas, LA, London, Amsterdam
- Pricing type: Pay-as-you-go
- Servers: Custom
- Supports Bedrock: Yes
- Free plan: No
- Trusted: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

##### TCPShield

TCPShield is the most popular service but it's more expensive than other OVH options like Infinity Filter. They have a great reputation and they're a very trusted option. Used by 2b2t and MrBeast.

- [Website](https://tcpshield.com)
- Locations: Germany, France, Canada (Montreal)
- Pricing type: Subscription
- Servers: OVH
- Supports Bedrock: Yes
- Free plan: Yes

##### MCShield

MCShield is a new but already popular option. It's ran by MCPROHOSTING and it only has one cheap plan. It's filters aren't the best but it's still an alright option for smaller servers and especially home hosted ones. 

- [Website](https://mcshield.com)
- [Locations](https://mcprohosting.com/billing/knowledgebase/106/Server-Locations-MCProHosting-Offers.html)
- Pricing type: Subscription
- Servers: CloudFlare

##### Papyrus VIP

Papyrus is a new option. They have quite a few locations and it's also very affordable. I recommend using them only if you have room for experimentation.

- [Website](https://papyrus.vip)
- Locations: New York, Frankfurt (Public) / [300+](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) on Enterprise Plans
- Pricing type: Subscription

##### NeoProtect

NeoProtect is also a newer option. They have a panel and some more budget-friendly plans compared to TCPShield.

- [Website](https://neoprotect.net)
- Locations: New York, Poland, and Germany
- Pricing type: Subscription
- Servers: OVH and GSL
- Supports Bedrock: Yes
- Free plan: Yes
- Trusted: ⭐⭐⭐

##### Lectron

Lectron isn't well known in the Minecraft community as they also focus on GTA, Metaverse and Crypto. You might find their huge amount of locations a plus but I would choose another service.

- [Website](https://www.lectron.com/)
- [Locations](https://www.lectron.com/locations/)
- Pricing type: Pay-as-you-go
- Servers: Path.net and CloudFlare
- Supports Bedrock: Yes
- Free plan: No
- Trusted: ⭐⭐

### Self hosted options
If you don't want to use a panel and you want more freedom, then these options will work for you. You don't run your Minecraft Server on these, you just use them as protection against attacks.

##### BuyVM

BuyVM is a good self hosted option but will need to choose the right server for your player count. If you run an offline mode server, you will need to setup some custom filters.

- [Website](https://buyvm.net)
- Locations: Las Vegas, New York, Miami, Luxembourg
- Pricing type: Subscription
- Servers: Path.net
- Supports Bedrock: Yes
- Free plan: No
- Trusted: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
